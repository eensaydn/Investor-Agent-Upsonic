"""
üí∞ Investment Report Generator - Upsonic Agent Implementation

This advanced example demonstrates how to build a sophisticated investment analysis system using the Upsonic agent framework.
The system uses a three-stage approach:
1. Comprehensive stock analysis and market research
2. Investment potential evaluation and ranking
3. Strategic portfolio allocation recommendations

Key capabilities:
- Real-time market data analysis
- Professional financial research
- Investment risk assessment
- Portfolio allocation strategy
- Detailed investment rationale

Example companies to analyze:
- "AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL" (Tech Giants)
- "NVDA, AMD, INTC" (Semiconductor Leaders)
- "TSLA, F, GM" (Automotive Innovation)
- "JPM, BAC, GS" (Banking Sector)
- "AMZN, WMT, TGT" (Retail Competition)
- "PFE, JNJ, MRNA" (Healthcare Focus)
- "XOM, CVX, BP" (Energy Sector)
